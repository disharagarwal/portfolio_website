        <h2>Refreshment Website</h2>
        It is a dynamic website built using React. It offers a variety of engaging features to refresh your mind, including games, news links, and a collection of novels to read. This README file provides an overview of the project and its key components.
        <ul> <h3>Features</h3>

            <li>Games: The website includes two interactive games to entertain users. The first game is a card-flipping game where the objective is to match pairs of cards. The second game involves controlling a ball to hit blocks and earn points.</li>

            <li>News Links: Stay updated with the latest news by accessing the provided news links. These links direct users to reputable news websites where they can explore various topics of interest.</li>

            <li>Novels Collection: Dive into a curated collection of captivating novels available for reading. Immerse yourself in different fictional worlds and let your imagination soar.</li></ul>

        <ul><h3>Technologies Used</h3>

        <li>React: The website is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of dynamic and interactive components, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.</li>

        <li>Figma: The initial design of the web pages was created using Figma, a collaborative design tool. Figma facilitated the visual planning and layout of the website, ensuring an appealing and user-friendly interface.</li>

        <li>MongoDB: The user login functionality was implemented using MongoDB, a powerful NoSQL database. MongoDB securely stores user information, enabling authentication and access control within the website.</li></ul>

        <h3>Flip the Card Game </h3>
        <ol>
        <li>There are several cards on the screen, face down.</li> 

        <li>When you click on a card, it flips over to reveal an image or some content.</li> 

        <li>The goal of the game is to match two cards with the same image/content by flipping them over one by one.</li> 

        <li>When you click on the first card, it stays flipped over, and when you click on the second card, it also stays flipped over.</li> 

        <li>If the two flipped cards have the same image/content, they stay flipped over, and you earn a point.</li> 

        <li>If the two flipped cards don't match, they flip back over, hiding the image/content.</li> 

        <li>You continue clicking on cards, trying to remember where the matching cards are located.</li> 

        <li>Once you have matched all the cards (found all pairs), you win the game.</li> 

        <li>The game keeps track of your score (number of matches found) and displays it on the screen.</li> 

        <li>The cards are shuffled randomly at the beginning of the game, so you need to rely on your memory to find the matching pairs.</li> 
        </ol></div>

    <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Ball Game </h3>
        <ol>
        <li>The game has a canvas, which is like a digital drawing board, where everything is displayed.</li> 

        <li>The player controls a ball on the canvas. They can move the ball and shoot projectiles.</li> 

        <li>The enemies are represented as tiles on the canvas. The player's goal is to destroy these tiles.</li> 

        <li>When the player clicks on the canvas, projectiles are shot from the player's ball towards the clicked position.</li> 

        <li>The enemies move around the canvas randomly, and if a projectile hits an enemy, both the enemy and the projectile disappear.</li> 

        <li>The player earns points for destroying enemies. The score is displayed on the screen.</li> 


        </ol>
