        <h2>Chat-Bot</h2>
        <p>The chatbot is a React component that allows users to interact with a conversational interface. It provides a chat-like interface where users can input their responses either through text or voice. The chatbot asks a series of predefined questions and captures the user's answers. It displays the conversation history and allows users to navigate through the questions.

        <ul>Libraries and technologies used:
           <li>React: The chatbot is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</li>
           <li> useState: The useState hook is used to manage the state of the chatbot component, such as messages and user inputs.</li>
           <li>useEffect: The useEffect hook is used to perform side effects, such as scrolling the chat window and initializing the initial question.</li>
            <li>The useRef hook is used to create a reference to the text input element for user input.</li>
            <li>Web Speech API: The Web Speech API is used to enable voice recognition functionality in the chatbot, allowing users to input responses through voice.</li>
