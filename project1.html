        <h2>Career Counselling App</h2>
        <p>As part of my portfolio, I developed a Career Counselling App using Flutter. This Android application aims to provide a digital solution for career counseling needs. With the help of this app, students can explore and gather relevant information about various career options in their chosen fields.</p>
        <p>The app includes an interactive prototype designed using Figma. The prototype offers a user-friendly and engaging interface for students to navigate through different career paths. It allows them to access comprehensive details, such as job prospects, educational requirements, salary ranges, and future growth opportunities for each career option.</p>
        <p>By leveraging the Career Counselling App, students can make well-informed decisions about their future careers. The app serves as a valuable resource for exploring and understanding the vast range of opportunities available to them, ensuring they are equipped with the necessary knowledge to pursue their desired career paths.</p>
